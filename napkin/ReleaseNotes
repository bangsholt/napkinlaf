     <tt>BasicFileChooserUI</tt> class seems entirely inadaquate).
<dt> Text areas are a normal size.
<dt> Paint background on each individual component, so changes to contents
     don't overlay on each other.

<dt> Fix fatal bug in tabbed panes
<dt> Show disabled buttons better

<dt> tabbed panes
<dt> fonts loaded from jar
<dt> new font: Felt Tip Roman (has bold + full char set)
<dd>
	I want to add a few choices of fonts; this release I'm just
	switching to the new one but next release I want to have
	them choosable because both are good.
