<h2>README: Napkin Look &amp; Feel</h2>

<hr>
<h4>What's here:</h4>

If you get the jars release, you will have two jar files (and this
<tt>README</tt>). The smaller one &mdash; <tt>napkinlaf.jar</tt> &mdash; is
the jar for the Napkin Look and Feel implementation. The larger one &mdash;
<tt>napkinlaf-swingset2.jar</tt> &mdash; contains both SwingSet2 classes so it can
be run as a demo thusly:

<pre>
    java -jar napkinlaf-swingset2.jar
</pre>

The SwingSet2 code is the one released in JDK 1.5. It has been modified to
allow an extensible set of look and feel types, including those with themes,
and to fix a couple of places where assumptions were made about how a look and
feel works that were not accurate.

<hr>

<h4>Using Napkin</h4>

You can set the look &amp; feel for Java applications. The Java tutorial <a
        href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/misc/plaf.html">describes
    the standard way to do this</a>. This will work for command line applications.
Changing it for applications that start from a desktop (such as by a
double-click) are more difficult to get at; you will have to poke at the
configuration for each such application. <a
        href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/kirillcool/archive/2005/08/intellij_idea_5.html">This
    page</a> shows how it's done for one application (JetBrain's <a
        href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDE</a>); maybe this will give
    you some ideas. It also shows how to make Napkin an installed look &amp; feel.

    <h4>Personal Stuff:</h4>

    <p> This is released under the BSD license specified below, but we're curious
        about anyone who does use it. We'd consider it a favor if you'd drop us a note
        about what you are doing with it and any comments you have.

    <p/><b>Peter Goodspeed</b> and <b>Justin Crafford</b> created the sketching
    subsystem, as a senior project for their degrees at Worcester Polytechnic
    Institute. They did a great job, and solved an important problem. And thanks to
    <b>Scott Anderson</b>, a fellow student and friend of mine who suggested they
    get in touch with me to look for a thesis project.

    <p/><b>Scott Violet</b> of Sun has helped me pick apart some of the more
    abstruse and arcane bits of the PLAF framework, which is full of 'em. Thanks a
    bunch, Scott, and thanks to <b>Hans Muller</b>, also of Sun, for plugging me
    together with him.

    <p> The font <a
            href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/felttiproman.html">Felt Tip Roman</a>
        was created by <b>Mark Simonson</b>, who spent a lot of time with me on how to
        license this. He has kindly decided that this particular use does not require
        individual licensing for each user of the LAF, but can be done by special
        arrangement. The legalities are below, but beyond those legalities, we'd like
        to ask you all to be cool &mdash; if you like the font and want to use it, buy
        it properly. Making fonts is not easy, and font folks get their work ripped
        off far too often. If you do want to use it, buy it from <a
            href="http://www.ms-studio.com ">his site</a>, where he gets more from it.

    <p> The font <a
            href="http://www.aenigmafonts.com/fonts/images/ab/aescfont.gif">&AElig;nigma
        Scrawl</a> was created by <b><a href="http://www.aenigmafonts.com/">Brian
        Kent</a></b>, and has worked very well for a handwritten font that scales
        reasonably to GUI-control sizes (most handwritten-style fonts are display fonts
        that only work in large sizes). To make things work better, Brian has adapted
        the font to adjust the spacing around some punctuation as well as some other
        tweaks. So the version released here is a custom one direct from the artist
        (which we believe he expects to roll back into the font at future date). We
        would like to thank Brian a lot for his quick and nimble cooperation, which
        made this work a lot better and easier on me.

    <p/><b>Miro Juri&#353;i&#263</b> has been very helpful in thinking through with
    me (sometimes <em>for</em> me) some of the hairy graphics problems. This
    definitely pushes into some poorly documented areas of the 2D API, and it has
    helped a lot to have someone to talk it through with. Thanks, Miro!

    <p/><b>Brian Hawthorne</b> created a quick and excellent selection of blueprint
    backgrounds for me to choose from. Thanks!

    <p/>Several people have helped with testing, reporting bugs, and suggesting
    things. The most persistent have been: <b>Deryl Steinert</b>, <b>Bob
    Herrmann</b>, <b>David Matuszek</b>, <b>Graham Perks</b>, <b>Henry Story</b>,
    and <b>Tom Eugelink</b>. Thanks to all, and we'll be happy to have <em>you</em>
    be added to this list.
