<h4><i>Latest Release: 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=238526">
alpha-004</a>, 15 May 2004</i></h4>

<ul>
<li> Progress bar gets scribbled in.
<li> File chooser (borrowed entirely from <tt>MetalFileChooserUI</tt>, as the
     <tt>BasicFileChooserUI</tt> class seems entirely inadaquate).
<li> Text areas are a normal size.
<li> Paint background on each individual component, so changes to contents
     don't overlay on each other.
<li> Much better about switching to/from Napkin LAF.
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The Napkin Look & Feel is a pluggable Java look and feel that looks
like it was scrawled on a napkin.  You can use it to make provisional
work actually look provisonal, or just for fun.
<p>
The idea is to try to develop a look and feel that can be used in
Java applications that looks informal and provisional, yet be fully
functional for development.  Often when people see a GUI mock-up, or
a complete GUI without full functionality, they assume that the code
behind it is working.  While this can be used to sleazy advantage,
it can also convince people who ought to know better (like your
managers) that you are already done when you have just barely begun,
or when only parts are complete.  No matter how much you speak to their
rational side, the emotional response still says "Done!".  Which after
a while leads to a later question: "That was done months ago!  What are
they doing?  Playing <i>Quake?</i>"  A good article on this is <i><a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software</a>'s</i> <a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000356.html">"The
Iceberg Secret, Revealed"</a>.
<p/>
So the idea is to create a complete look and feel that can be used while
the thing is not done which will convey an emotional message to match the
rational one.  As pieces of the work are done, the GUI for those pieces
can be switched to use the "formal" (final) look and feel, allowing
someone looking at demos over time to see the progress of the entire
system reflected in the expression of the GUI.
<p/>
This is all done using the Java Swing pluggable Look & Feel framework.

<h2>Development</h2>
I currently have a basic background model and many of the most basic
components working.

I welcome anyone to contribute -- thoughts, code, understanding, chocolate...
