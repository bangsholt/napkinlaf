<h4>Beta!</h4>

I have declared "Beta".  Things seem to basically work, but there are certainly
some issues still.  Nonetheless, it seems to meet the web standard of "beta".

<h4><i>Latest Release: 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=104116&package_id=111904">
beta-003, 10 August, 2004</i></h4></a>

<ul>
<li>Fixed bug 1003040, which had dragging anywhere in a window drag the whole
    window around.  This turned out to be a Mac Java problem.
<li>Added "blueprint" theme.  Thanks to Brian Hawthorne for creating the
    background!
<li>Make SwingSet2 use Napkin themes in menu when its the L&F (that was hard).
<li>Use more properties instead of hard-wired values for colors, etc.
<li>Added a basic "themes" notion: <tt>NapkinTheme</tt> and its
    contained classes.
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The Napkin Look & Feel is a pluggable Java look and feel that looks
like it was scrawled on a napkin.  You can use it to make provisional
work actually look provisonal, or just for fun.
<p>
The idea is to try to develop a look and feel that can be used in
Java applications that looks informal and provisional, yet be fully
functional for development.  Often when people see a GUI mock-up, or
a complete GUI without full functionality, they assume that the code
behind it is working.  While this can be used to sleazy advantage,
it can also convince people who ought to know better (like your
managers) that you are already done when you have just barely begun,
or when only parts are complete.  No matter how much you speak to their
rational side, the emotional response still says "Done!".  Which after
a while leads to a later question: "That was done months ago!  What are
they doing?  Playing <i>Quake?</i>"  A good article on this is <i><a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software</a>'s</i> <a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000356.html">"The
Iceberg Secret, Revealed"</a>.
<p/>
So the idea is to create a complete look and feel that can be used while
the thing is not done which will convey an emotional message to match the
rational one.  As pieces of the work are done, the GUI for those pieces
can be switched to use the "formal" (final) look and feel, allowing
someone looking at demos over time to see the progress of the entire
system reflected in the expression of the GUI.
<p/>
This is all done using the Java Swing pluggable Look & Feel framework.

    <dd> "I have added the napkin L&F to BlogEd and made it the
    default when run from cvs using 'ant run'. We can easily change
    it back if it gets in the way. The only bug I have noticed
    currently is that the pulling on the scrollbar seems to move
    the whole window. Perhaps Ken Arnold will know what the problem
    is there."
