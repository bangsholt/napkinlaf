What's here:

If you get the jars release, you will have two jar files (and this
README).  The smaller one -- napkinlaf.jar -- is the jar for the
Napkin Look and Feel.  The larger one -- napkin-swingset2.jar --
contains both SwingSet2 classes so it can be run as a demo thusly:

    java -jar napkinlaf-swingset2.jar

Personal Stuff:

You may use this under the BSD license specified below, but we're
curious about anyone who does use it.  We'd consider it a favor if
you'd drop us a note about what you are doing with it and any
comments you have.

The font Felt Tip Roman was created by Mark Simonson, who spent a
lot of time with me on how to license this.  He has kindly decided
that this particular use does not require individual licensing for
each user of the LAF, but can be done by special arrangement.  The
legalities are below, but beyond those legalities, we'd like to ask
you all to be cool -- if you like the font and want to use it, buy
it properly.  Making fonts is not easy, and font folks get their
work ripped off far too often.  If you do want to use it, buy it
from his site http://www.ms-studio.com, where he gets more from it.

The font Ænigma Scrawl was created by Brian Kent, and has worked
very well for a handwritten font that scales reasonably to GUI-control
sizes (most handwritten-style fonts are display fonts that only
work in large sizes).  To make things work better, Brian has adapted
the font to adjust the spacing around some punctuation as well as
some other tweaks.  So the version released here is a custom one
direct from the artist (which we believe he expects to roll back
into the font at future date).  We would like to thank Brian a lot
for his quick and nimble cooperation, which made this work a lot
better and easier on me.

Miro Jurisic [*] has been very helpful in thinking through with me
(sometimes for me) some of the hairy graphics problems.  This definitely
pushes into some poorly documented areas of the 2D API, and it has
helped a lot to have someone to talk it through with.  Thanks, Miro!

[*] This really requires some non-ISO-Latin-1 chars to spell properly,
but so far I'm keeping this file in a standard encoding, so Miro will
have to, once more, settle for an approximation of his own name.  Someday
everything will be in Unicode and we will all be happy.  Maybe.

!!! NOTE !!!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This font has been updated!  I've edited the (BRK) in the font name
to just BRK.  It seems that Adobe Illustrator and web pages with CSS
don't like fonts with ( and ) in their name.

INSTALLING FONTS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  There's a couple of ways to install Fonts. The 'easy' way to
install fonts is to just Unzip/place the font file [.ttf] into your
Windows\Fonts directory (I always use this method). If you're unable
to do it the 'easy' way, then try to do it this way (for Windows
95/98/NT):

1] Unzip the Font(s) to a folder (or somewhere, just remember where
you unzipped it) on your Computer.

2] Next, click on the START button, then select SETTINGS then
CONTROL PANEL.

3] When the Control Panel Window pops up, Double Click on FONTS.

4] When the FONTS window pops up, select File then Install New Font...

5] A Add Fonts window will pop up, just go to the folder that you
unzipped the Font(s) to, select the Font(s) and then click on OK.
Now the Font(s) are installed.

  Now you can use the Font(s) in programs the utilize Fonts.  Make
sure that you install the font(s) first, then open up your apps
(so the app will recognize the font).    Sometimes you'll have to
wait until you computer 'auto-refreshes' for programs to recognize
fonts (Windows is sometimes slow to do that).  You can refresh your
computer quicker by going into Windows Explorer -or- My Computer and
press F5 (or in the menubar select VIEW then REFRESH).

Legal Stuff: The Typewriter Font

I downloaded this from http://www.abstractfonts.com/fonts/ which
came with no attribution or README or anything but the TTF file.
AbstractFonts seems to be good about that kind of thing, so I have
assumed that it is in the public domain.  If anyone knows better,
or has a way to give proper credit and attribution, please let me
know.
