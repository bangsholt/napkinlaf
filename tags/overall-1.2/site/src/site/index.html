<ul>

    <li><b>Sketchified Images:</b> We have added a new mechanism that will take
        an image and make a "sketched" version of it. This will allow your
        images to look provisional as well, to fit in with the overall theme.
        The <tt>SketchifiedImage</tt> and <tt>SketchifiedIcon</tt> classes are
        what you need to do this. The example <tt>Sketchifier</tt> class shows a
        simple way to use it.

    <li><b>Merged Fonts:</b> Handwritten fonts often are relatively limited in
        their space. There certainly is no single Unicode handwritten font we
        are aware of. So we have created a way to have a pseudo-font that is a
        composite of other fonts in a search order. We use this to back our
        handwritten fonts with a full Unicode font so at least no letter will be
        undisplayed.

    <li><b>Highlighting:</b> We use highlighter pen effects to mark default
        buttons and selected items.

    <li><b><tt>JFrame</tt> borders:</b> <tt>JFrame</tt>s now have sketched
        borders.

    <li><b>Abstract Template Colors:</b> You can specify a color for a template
        that is based on the theme, such as <tt>PEN</tt> or <tt>HIGHLIGHT</tt>.

</ul>

<h2><a name="Overview"/>Overview</h2>

<p>The Napkin Look & Feel is a pluggable Java look and feel that looks like it
    was scrawled on a napkin. You can use it to make provisional work actually
    look provisional, or just for fun.

<p>The idea is to try to develop a look and feel that can be used in Java
    applications that looks informal and provisional, yet be fully functional
    for development. Often when people see a GUI mock-up, or a complete GUI
    without full functionality, they assume that the code behind it is working.
    While this can be used to sleazy advantage, it can also convince people who
    ought to know better (like your managers) that you are already done when you
    have just barely begun, or when only parts are complete. No matter how much
    you speak to their rational side, the emotional response still says "Done!".
    Which after a while leads to a later question: "That was done months ago!
    What are they doing? Playing <i>Quake</i>?" A good article on this is <a
        href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software</a>'s &ldquo;<a
        href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000356.html">The
    Iceberg Secret, Revealed</a>&rdquo;.

<p>So the idea is to create a complete look and feel that can be used while the
    thing is not done which will convey an emotional message to match the
    rational one. As pieces of the work are done, the GUI for those pieces can
    be switched to use the "formal" (final) look and feel, allowing someone
    looking at demos over time to see the progress of the entire system
    reflected in the expression of the GUI.

<p>Over time, several folks have just liked the thing and wanted to use it for
    non-provisional GUI's. Sometimes this is because the application itself
    seems to match the theme, such as a brainstorming tool. And sometimes it's
    just that it looks fun.

<p>This is all done using the Java Swing pluggable Look & Feel framework.

<h2><a name="Acknowledgments"/>Acknowledgments</h2>

<p><b>Peter Goodspeed</b> and <b>Justin Crafford</b> created the sketching
    subsystem, as a senior project for their degrees at Worcester Polytechnic
    Institute. They did a great job, and solved an important problem. And thanks
    to <b>Scott Anderson</b>, a fellow student and friend of mine who suggested
    they get in touch with me to look for a thesis project.

<p><b>Scott Violet</b> of Sun has helped me pick apart some of the more abstruse
    and arcane bits of the PLAF framework, which is full of 'em. Thanks a bunch,
    Scott, and thanks to <b>Hans Muller</b>, also of Sun, for plugging me
    together with him.

<p><b>Brandon Franklin</b> has contributed many spare cycles (of which he has
    none) to planning the upgrade to 1.5, making the whole process <em>much</em>
    easier.

<p>The font "Felt Tip Roman" was created by <b>Mark Simonson</b>, who spent a
    lot of time with me on how to license this. He has kindly decided that this
    particular use does not require individual licensing for each user of the
    LAF, but can be done by special arrangement. The legalities are below, but
    beyond those legalities, we'd like to ask you all to be cool &mdash; if you
    like the font and want to use it, buy it properly. Making fonts is not easy,
    and font folks get their work ripped off far too often. If you do want to
    use it, buy it from his site <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/">
    http://www.ms-studio.com/</a>, where he gets more from it.

<p>The font "&AElig;nigma Scrawl" was created by <b>Brian Kent</b>, and has
    worked very well for a handwritten font that scales reasonably to
    GUI-control sizes (most handwritten-style fonts are display fonts that only
    work in large sizes). To make things work better, Brian has adapted the font
    to adjust the spacing around some punctuation as well as some other tweaks.
    So the version released here is a custom one direct from the artist (which
    we believe he expects to roll back into the font at future date). We would
    like to thank Brian a lot for his quick and nimble cooperation, which made
    this work a lot better and easier on me.

<p><b>Miro Juri&#353;i&#263</b> has been very helpful in thinking through with
    me (sometimes <em>for</em> me) some of the hairy graphics problems. This
    definitely pushes into some poorly documented areas of the 2D API, and it
    has helped a lot to have someone to talk it through with. Thanks, Miro!

<p><b>Brian Hawthorne</b> created a quick and excellent selection of blueprint
    backgrounds for me to choose from. Thanks!

<p>Several people have helped with testing, reporting bugs, and suggesting
    things. The most persistent have been: <b>Deryl Steinert</b>, <b>Bob
    Herrmann</b>, <b>David Matuszek</b>, <b>Graham Perks</b>, <b>Henry Story</b>,
    and <b>Tom Eugelink</b>. Thanks to all.

<p>We'll be happy to add <b>you</b> to this list, so join in!
