        <h2>Release Notes: Napkin Look & Feel</h2>

        <h3>Things You Ought To Know</h3>

Here are some things you ought to know if you are going to use the Napkin
Look & Feel in your work.

    <ul>

        <li>Napkin does not work with JDK 1.3.  The PLAF framework is quite
    different between the two.

        <li>It takes time to draw all the variations that make up the "hand
    drawn" look of Napkin.  You will therefore notice that it is rather
    slower than other L&Fs, although it seems quite usable on a
    "modern" system.  I'm sure this could be made better, but I
    think it will be inevitable.

    <li><tt>JViewport</tt> requires "simple" scrolling
    (<tt>JViewport.SIMPLE_SCROLL_MODE).  So it will actively ignore
    any other mode you set, although it will remember the other
    mode and restore it when you swtich away from Napkin.

    <li>You will not get handwritten text (by default) in HTML, or at
    least if you do that is platform dependent.  This is not possible
    to set in JDK 1.4, but will be in JDK 1.5.





    </ul>

        <h3>Change History</h3>

        <h4>beta-006, 29 August, 2004</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Fixed fonts so they work under 1.5 (Thanks to Mark Fairchild!)
            <li>Selected text use the correct pen color.
        <li>Selected text use the correct pen color.
        <li>Titled borders use correct pen color.
        <li>Labels look disabled when disabled.




        </ul>

        <h4>beta-005, 29 August, 2004</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Sliders drag without leaving droplets behind.
            <li>Dragging internal frames and scroll bars no longer leave junk around edges
    [bug 1007324 and bug 1007327]
        <li>Icons for internal frames now work well enough.
        <li>A completely new, stupider, and hence more reliable model for paper, so
    the right color scheme should always be used.
        <li>Tweaking with glass panes to get the opacity settings right (very bizarre).
        <li>Make progress bar stop clearing its own background.
        <li>JTree now does something napkin-ish. [fr 1019700]
        <li>Scrolling repaints entire background to keep it correct. [bug 1019688]
        <li>Automatically tag the CVS version.
        <li>Use selection color for selections in JList.




        </ul>

        <h4>beta-004, 29 August, 2004</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Can switch to other L&Fs without problems. [bug 997786]
            <li>Several theme-related color fixes.
        <li>"Selection color" added to theme.
        <li>Make internal frames resizable. [bug 1007542]
        <li>Use selection color for toggle button borders [bug 1007554]
        <li>SwingSet file selection dialog shows error if run from applet (the applet
    can't read files so it can't create a file selection dialog). [bug 1007321]
        <li>New fixed-width font ("1942") with more characters. [bug 1007573]
        <li>Handle all component padding. [bug 1007543]
        <li>CVS <tt>Id</tt> tags in all source files.
        <li>Added acknowledgements to README (I can't <em>believe</em> it took me this
    long to think to do this).




        </ul>

        <h4>beta-003, 10 August, 2004</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Fixed bug 1003040, which had dragging anywhere in a window drag the whole
    window around.  This turned out to be a Mac Java problem.
            <li>Added "blueprint" theme.  Thanks to Brian Hawthorne for creating the
    background!
        <li>Make SwingSet2 use Napkin themes in menu when its the L&F (that was hard).
        <li>Use more properties instead of hard-wired values for colors, etc.
        <li>Added a basic "themes" notion: <tt>NapkinTheme</tt> and its
    contained classes.




        </ul>

        <h4>beta-002, 23 July, 2004</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Check for debug property in security context to avoid security exception.
                <i>(This caused impenetrable failures in web start and anywhere else
    security was in place, so it gets a release of its own.)</i>
        </ul>

        <h4>beta-001, 21 July, 2004</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>No drawn border on postit paper.
            <li>Internal frames done on postit paper.
        <li>New background model; backgrounds should now work properly.
        <li>All components will be marked disabled by pseudo-erasure.  Again, thanks
    to graphics help from Miro Juri&#353;i&#263.
        <li>Thanks to debugging and modeling help from Miro Juri&#353;i&#263; we can
    now render "hand-drawn" lines at an angle.




        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h4>alpha-007, 2 July, 2004</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Fixed bug that made disabled buttons peg the CPU (bug 964358).
            <li>Thicker button marker lines.
        <li>Can delete, etc. in text fields and areas (bug 968192).
        <li>Make highlight color like yellow highlighter.




        </ul>

        <h4>alpha-006, 19 June, 2004</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Better red for radio button marks, etc.
            <li>Wrap all non-Napkin borders, not just default borders.
        <li>Do progress bar scribbling on image so it's cheaper to redraw.
        <li>Reduced bias for "too high" when drawing longer lines.
        <li>Disabled line height adjusted, and put behind the text (black shows
    through).  (Maybe should do color blending?)
        <li>Use a simple underline for text and password fields, not a box.
        <li>Use red line for disabled; green for "default button".
        <li>All the buttons are drawn the same when they are disabled (and they now
    look disabled too, instead of looking bold).




        </ul>

        <h4>alpha-005, 30 May, 2004</h4>

        <ul>
            <li> <b>Note:</b> This LAF will not work under Java 1.3.  There were many
     changes in the LAF infrastructure and I can't figure out a way to do
     one development for both versions. [<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=963198&group_id=104116&atid=636983">bug 963198</a>]
            <li> Put SwingSet2 source in the swingset jar file.
        <li> No longer need "switch and back" to make demo work.  (This was a bug in
     SwingSet2.)
        <li> Get titled borders working.
        <li> Separators.
        <li> Set all the properties to use drawn borders.
        <li> Wrap all borders in a simple thing that at least anti-aliases all the
     the stuff.
        <li> Indeterminate progress bar.
        <li> Split panes.




        </ul>

        <h4>alpha-004, 15 May 2004</h4>

        <ul>
            <li> Progress bar gets scribbled in.
            <li> File chooser (borrowed entirely from <tt>MetalFileChooserUI</tt>, as the
             <tt>BasicFileChooserUI</tt> class seems entirely inadequate).
        <li> Text areas are a normal size.
        <li> Paint background on each individual component, so changes to contents
     don't overlay on each other.
        <li> Much better about switching to/from Napkin LAF.




        </ul>

        <h4>alpha-003, 16 April 2004</h4>

        <ul>
            <li> Fix fatal bug in tabbed panes
            <li> Show disabled buttons better




        </ul>

        <h4>alpha-002, 11 April 2004</h4>

        <ul>
            <li> tabbed panes
            <li> fonts loaded from jar
        <li> new font: Felt Tip Roman (has bold + full char set)
            <i>I want to add a few choices of fonts; this release I'm just
    switching to the new one but next release I want to have them
    choosable because both are good.</i>
            <li> build the release automatically
            <li> bugs, bugs, bugs




        </ul>
