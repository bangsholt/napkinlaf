<title>Release Notes: Napkin Look & Feel</title>

<body>

<h4>alpha-006, 30 May, 2004</h4>
<ul>
<li>Wrap all non-Napkin borders, not just default borders.
<li>Do progress bar scribbling on image so it's cheaper to redraw.
<li>Reduced bias for "too high" when drawing longer lines.
<li>Disabled line height adjusted, and put behind the text (black shows
    through).  (Maybe should do color blending?)
<li>Use a simple underline for text and password fields, not a box.
<li>Use red line for disabled; green for "default button".
<li>All the buttons are drawn the same when they are disabled (and they now
    look disabled too, instead of looking bold).
</ul>

<h4>alpha-005, 30 May, 2004</h4>

<ul>
<li> <b>Note:</b> This LaF will not work under Java 1.3.  There were many
     changes in the LaF infrastructure and I can't figure out a way to do
     one development for both versions. [<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=963198&group_id=104116&atid=636983">bug 963198</a>]
<li> Put SwingSet2 source in the swingset jar file.
<li> No longer need "switch and back" to make demo work.  (This was a bug in
     SwingSet2.)
<li> Get titled borders working.
<li> Separators.
<li> Set all the properties to use drawn borders.
<li> Wrap all borders in a simple thing that at least anti-aliases all the
     the stuff.
<li> Indeterminate progress bar.
<li> Split panes.
</ul>

<h4>alpha-004, 15 May 2004</h4>

<ul>
<li> Progress bar gets scribbled in.
<li> File chooser (borrowed entirely from <tt>MetalFileChooserUI</tt>, as the
     <tt>BasicFileChooserUI</tt> class seems entirely inadaquate).
<li> Text areas are a normal size.
<li> Paint background on each individual component, so changes to contents
     don't overlay on each other.
<li> Much better about switching to/from Napkin LAF.
</ul>

<h4>alpha-003, 16 April 2004</h4>

<ul>
<li> Fix fatal bug in tabbed panes
<li> Show disabled buttons better
</ul>

<h4>alpha-002, 11 April 2004</h4>

<ul>
<li> tabbed panes
<li> fonts loaded from jar
<li> new font: Felt Tip Roman (has bold + full char set)
    <i>I want to add a few choices of fonts; this release I'm just
    switching to the new one but next release I want to have them
    choosable because both are good.</i>
<li> build the relase automatically
<li> bugs, bugs, bugs
</ul>
