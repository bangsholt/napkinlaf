(*) tabbed panes
(*) fonts loaded from jar
(*) new font: Felt Tip Roman (has bold + full char set)
	I want to add a few choices of fonts; this release I'm just
	switching to the new one but next release I want to have
	them choosable because both are good.
(*) build the relase automatically
(*) bugs, bugs, bugs
