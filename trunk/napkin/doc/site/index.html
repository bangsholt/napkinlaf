<h4><i>Latest Release:

<ul>
<li>Sliders drag without leaving droplets behind.
<li>Dragging internal frames and scroll bars no longer leave junk around edges
    [bug 1007324 and bug 1007327]
<li>Icons for internal frames now work well enough.
<li>A completely new, stupider, and hence more reliable model for paper, so
    the right color scheme should always be used.
<li>Tweaking with glass panes to get the opacity settings right (very bizarre).
<li>Make progress bar stop clearing its own background.
<li>JTree now does something napkin-ish. [fr 1019700]
<li>Scrolling repaints entire background to keep it correct. [bug 1019688]
<li>Automatically tag the CVS version.
<li>Use selection color for selections in JList.
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The Napkin Look & Feel is a pluggable Java look and feel that looks
like it was scrawled on a napkin.  You can use it to make provisional
work actually look provisonal, or just for fun.
<p>
The idea is to try to develop a look and feel that can be used in
Java applications that looks informal and provisional, yet be fully
functional for development.  Often when people see a GUI mock-up, or
a complete GUI without full functionality, they assume that the code
behind it is working.  While this can be used to sleazy advantage,
it can also convince people who ought to know better (like your
managers) that you are already done when you have just barely begun,
or when only parts are complete.  No matter how much you speak to their
rational side, the emotional response still says "Done!".  Which after
a while leads to a later question: "That was done months ago!  What are
they doing?  Playing <i>Quake?</i>"  A good article on this is <i><a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software</a>'s</i> <a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000356.html">"The
Iceberg Secret, Revealed"</a>.
<p/>
So the idea is to create a complete look and feel that can be used while
the thing is not done which will convey an emotional message to match the
rational one.  As pieces of the work are done, the GUI for those pieces
can be switched to use the "formal" (final) look and feel, allowing
someone looking at demos over time to see the progress of the entire
system reflected in the expression of the GUI.
<p/>
This is all done using the Java Swing pluggable Look & Feel framework.

    <dd> "I have added the napkin L&F to BlogEd and made it the
    default when run from cvs using 'ant run'. We can easily change
    it back if it gets in the way. The only bug I have noticed
    currently is that the pulling on the scrollbar seems to move
    the whole window. Perhaps Ken Arnold will know what the problem
    is there."

<h2>Development</h2>
I welcome anyone to contribute -- thoughts, code, understanding, chocolate...

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

The font Felt Tip Roman was created by <b>Mark Simonson</b>, who
spent a lot of time with me on how to license this.  He has kindly
decided that this particular use does not require individual licensing
for each user of the LAF, but can be done by special arrangement.
The legalities are below, but beyond those legalities, we'd like
to ask you all to be cool &mdash; if you like the font and want to
use it, buy it properly.  Making fonts is not easy, and font folks
get their work ripped off far too often.  If you do want to use it,
buy it from his site <a
href="http://www.ms-studio.com">http://www.ms-studio.com</a>, where
he gets more from it.

<p>

The font &AElig;nigma Scrawl was created by <b>Brian Kent</b>, and
has worked very well for a handwritten font that scales reasonably
to GUI-control sizes (most handwritten-style fonts are display fonts
that only work in large sizes).  To make things work better, Brian
has adapted the font to adjust the spacing around some punctuation
as well as some other tweaks.  So the version released here is a
custom one direct from the artist (which we believe he expects to
roll back into the font at future date).  We would like to thank
Brian a lot for his quick and nimble cooperation, which made this
work a lot better and easier on me.

<p> <b>Miro Juri&#353;i&#263</b> has been very helpful in thinking
through <tt>with</tt> me (sometimes <em>for</em> me) some of the
hairy graphics problems.  This definitely pushes into some poorly
documented areas of the 2D API, and it has helped a lot to have
someone to talk it through with.  Thanks, Miro!

<p> <b>Brian Hawthorne</b> did a quick and excellent selection of
blueprint backgrounds for me to choose from.  Thanks!

<p> <b>Scott Violet</b> of Sun has helped me pick apart some of the
more abstruse and arcane bits of the plaf framework, which is full
of 'em.  Thanks a bunch, Scott, and thanks to <b>Hans Muller</b>,
also of Sun, for plugging me together with him.

<p> Several people have helped with testing, reporting bugs, and
suggesting things.  The most persistent have been: <b>Deryl
Steinert</b>, <b>Bob Herrmann</b>, <b>David Matuszek</b>, <b>Graham
Perks</b>, <b>Henry Story</b>, and <b>Tom Eugelink</b>.  Thanks to
all, and happy to have <em>you</em> be added to this list.
